# DEF-PIPE-Frontend

This project is a continuation of the work based on https://github.com/DataCloud-project/DEF-PIPE-Frontend.

The objective of this project is to add a functionality that transforms defined Big Data pipelines into YAML files, which can be executed by Argo Workflow. Additionally, it aims to increase the complexity of the pipelines.

See 'update_dsl' branch for the changes.
